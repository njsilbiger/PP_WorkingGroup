HTN: TN time (hhmm)
TX: maximum temperature under shelter (in Â°C and 1/10)
HTX: TX time (hhmm)
TM: daily average of hourly temperatures under shelter (in Â°C and 1/10)
TNTXM: daily average (TN+TX)/2 (in Â°C and 1/10)
TAMPLI: daily thermal amplitude: difference between daily TX and TN (TX-TN) (in Â°C and 1/10)
TNSOL: minimum daily temperature at 10 cm above ground (in Â°C and 1/10)
TN50: minimum daily temperature at 50 cm above ground (in Â°C and 1/10)
DG: duration of frost under shelter (T â‰¤ 0Â°C) (in min)
FFM: daily average wind force averaged over 10 min, at 10 m (in m/s and 1/10)
FF2M: daily average wind force averaged over 10 min, at 2 m (in m/s and 1/10)
FXY: daily maximum of the maximum hourly wind force averaged over 10 min, at 10 m (in m/s and 1/10)
DXY: direction of FXY (in pink of 360)

FXI: daily maximum of the instantaneous hourly maximum wind force, at 10 m (in m/s and 1/10)
DXI: direction of FXI (in pink 360)
HXI: FXI time (hhmm)
FXI2: daily maximum of the instantaneous hourly maximum wind force, at 2 m (in m/s and 1/10)
DXI2: direction of FXI2 (in pink of 360)
HXI2: FXI2 time (hhmm)
FXI3S: daily maximum of the maximum hourly wind force averaged over 3 s, at 10 m (in m/s and 1/10)
DXI3S: direction of FXI3S (in pink of 360)
HXI3S: FXI3S time (hhmm)
DRR: duration of precipitation (in min)

Each data item is associated with a quality code (e.g. T;QT):
 9: filtered data (data has passed first level filters/checks)
 0: protected data (the data has been definitively validated by the climatologist)
 1: validated data (the data has been validated by automatic control or by the climatologist)
 2: questionable data being verified (the data has been called into question by automatic control)
 
Generally speaking, the values ​​provided are given with a precision that roughly corresponds to the resolution of the value measuring device.
However, it may happen, for technical reasons of storage or extraction of values, that this rule is not respected.
Due to rounding, it may occasionally happen that base values ​​at a lower time step (e.g. minute data) are not exactly consistent with their correspondents at a higher time step (e.g. hourly data).
